## 1. Objective

To analyse the Campus Smart-Parking System, identify candidate classes and their responsibilities, define business rules and assumptions, and compare an object-oriented design with a parallel-array approach using time and space complexity.

## 2. Problem Description

The Campus Smart-Parking System manages a multi-level parking facility used by students, staff and visitors. It supports two-wheelers, cars and electric vehicles (EVs).

The system allocates suitable parking slots, issues unique parking tickets, records entry and exit times, calculates parking fees, releases slots and validates monthly passes. EV charging fees are calculated separately.

## 3. Work Completed

- Analysed the problem and identified system inputs and outputs.
- Identified candidate classes from the nouns in the problem statement and justified their purpose.
- Defined the responsibilities of each candidate class.
- Mapped problem actions to proposed Java methods.
- Documented business rules for valid parking operations.
- Stated assumptions about the parking facility.
- Compared object-oriented vehicle representation with parallel arrays.
- Analysed search time and space complexity using Big-O notation.

## 4. Candidate Classes and Interface

The proposed object-oriented model contains the following classes and interface:

- `Vehicle` – Abstract superclass defining common vehicle behaviour and fee calculation.
- `TwoWheeler`, `Car`, `ElectricCar` – Represent specific vehicle categories.
- `ParkingTicket` – Records ticket details and the parking session.
- `ParkingFacility` – Manages parking slots, allocation, release, active tickets and ticket numbering.
- `ParkingUser`, `Student`, `Staff`, `Visitor` – Represent user categories and parking eligibility.
- `MonthlyPass` – Stores pass validity information and determines whether a pass is valid.
- `FeeCalculator` – Calculates parking fees, pass exemptions and EV charging fees.
- `Chargeable` – Defines the charging capability for eligible vehicles.
- `ParkingApp` – Handles input, invokes the model and displays results.

## 5. Inputs, Outputs, Business Rules and Assumptions

### Inputs and Outputs

Inputs include facility configuration, vehicle registration number and type, user category, entry and exit times, monthly pass information and EV charging consumption.

Outputs include the allocated floor and slot, unique ticket number, parking duration, parking fee, charging fee, total amount payable, slot availability and daily collection.

### Business Rules

- A parking slot cannot hold more than one vehicle.
- A vehicle cannot be parked twice simultaneously.
- Ticket numbers must be unique and must never be reused.
- A full facility or unavailable slot must not result in an invalid allocation.
- Only valid occupied slots may be released, and a slot cannot be released twice.
- Exit time cannot precede entry time, and a ticket can be closed only once.
- Parking fees depend on vehicle type and parking duration.
- Eligible students and staff with valid monthly passes receive free parking.
- EV charging fees are calculated separately.
- Invalid vehicle information must be rejected.

### Assumptions

- The facility configuration remains fixed during execution.
- Any free slot can initially accommodate any vehicle type.
- The allocation policy selects the first available slot, searching from the lowest floor and slot number.
- Floors and slots are indexed from zero inside the program.
- Parking duration is measured in whole minutes, and every started hour is charged in full.
- Ticket numbers start at 1 and increase with each ticket issued.
- Data is maintained in memory without a database or payment gateway.

## 6. Alternative Concept and Complexity Analysis

The alternative design stores vehicle information in parallel arrays. Corresponding indexes represent the same vehicle. This approach is compared with the object-oriented design for searching by registration number and introducing new attributes.

### 6.1 Parallel-Array Code Snippet

The following Java code illustrates the alternative approach presented in the problem-analysis report.

```java
String[] regNo = new String[MAX];
String[] type = new String[MAX];
String[] entryTime = new String[MAX];
int count = 0;

int find(String reg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
        if (regNo[i].equals(reg))
            return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `regNo[]` stores vehicle registration numbers.
- `type[]` stores vehicle types.
- `entryTime[]` stores entry times as text, such as `"09:15"`.
- `count` tracks the number of stored vehicles.
- `find()` searches by registration number and returns the matching index or `-1` if no match exists.

The entry time must be parsed into minutes before fee calculation. This is an illustrative code excerpt, not a standalone Java program; `MAX` and the surrounding class fields must be defined for execution.

### 6.2 Object-Oriented Search Approach

In the object-oriented design, vehicle information is stored in objects referenced through an array such as `Vehicle[] parked`.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    if (parked[i].getRegNo().equals(reg))
        return i;
}
return -1;
```

The search examines each vehicle's registration number through `getRegNo()`. This is an illustrative method excerpt rather than a complete program.

### 6.3 Complexity Comparison

Let `n` represent the number of stored vehicles.

| Criterion | Vehicle Objects | Parallel Arrays |
|---|---|---|
| Worst-case search time | O(n) | O(n) |
| Best-case search time | O(1) | O(1) |
| Space per vehicle | O(1) | O(1) |
| Total space for n vehicles | O(n) | O(n) |
| Adding an attribute | Update the class and relevant construction or access code | Add another array and maintain matching indexes |
| Extensibility | Supports subclasses and encapsulated behaviour | Requires consistent management of multiple arrays |

Both approaches have the same asymptotic search complexity when using linear search. The object-oriented approach groups related data and behaviour, improves type safety and makes it easier to introduce new vehicle categories and attributes.

Memory usage depends on the implementation and JVM. Any byte-level memory figures are estimates, not measured results.

## 7. Files Included

- `Task1_Problem_Analysis.pdf` – Contains the complete written analysis, inputs and outputs, candidate-class justification, class responsibilities, method mapping, business rules, assumptions, alternative-design code and complexity comparison.
- `README.md` – Documents the scope, analytical approach, illustrative code snippets and result of Task 1.

## 8. Result

The Campus Smart-Parking System was analysed by identifying its inputs and outputs, candidate classes, class responsibilities, methods, business rules and assumptions. The object-oriented approach was compared with the parallel-array alternative in terms of search complexity, storage and extensibility.

## 9. Execution Requirement

Task 1 is primarily a problem-analysis task. The assignment does not specify a separate executable Java program for this task. The code snippets illustrate the alternative data representation and search approaches discussed in the report.

Java implementation and execution evidence will be provided in the task folders for tasks that explicitly require programming.
